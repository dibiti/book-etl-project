# Book ETL Project - Books to Scrape

This project implements an ETL pipeline in Python that collects book data from the website [Books to Scrape](http://books.toscrape.com/), transforms the data, and saves it into a CSV file.

## Project Structure

```
book-etl-project/
├── etl/
│   ├── extract.py       # Extracts data from the website
│   ├── transform.py     # Cleans and standardizes the data
│   └── load.py          # Saves the data into a CSV file
│   └── load_sqlite.py      # Saves the data to SQLite
├── data/
│   ├── books.csv        # File generated by the ETL process
│   └── books.db            # SQLite database
├── inspect_sqlite.py       # Script to view or query the SQLite DB
├── main.py              # Entry point to run the ETL pipeline
├── requirements.txt     # Required libraries
├── README.md            # Project description and instructions
└── .gitignore           # Ignored files and folders
```

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dibiti/book-etl-project.git
cd book-etl-project
```

2. Install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the pipeline:
```bash
python main.py
```

This will create:

- `data/books.csv`: a clean CSV file
- `data/books.db`: a SQLite database with a `books` table

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for web scraping
- `pandas` for data transformation
- `sqlite3` for database storage

---

## 📘 Explore the Data in SQLite

You can inspect the contents of the `books.db` SQLite database using Python:

```bash
python inspect_sqlite.py
```

Or explore it visually using [**DB Browser for SQLite**](https://sqlitebrowser.org/):

- Download and install the application.
- Open the file `data/books.db`.
- Go to the **"Browse Data"** tab and select the `books` table.
- You can also run SQL queries in the **"Execute SQL"** tab.
